# matplotlib_challenge
The main objective of this challenge was to explore and visualize the data obtained from a study of the efficacy of various drug regimens on tumor development in mice, focusing primarily on the drug Capomulin, among others. The first steps involved loading and merging the datasets for comprehensive analysis, followed by data cleaning procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Duplicate entries, particularly those with the same 'Mouse ID' and 'Timepoint', were identified and subsequently excluded from further investigation to maintain data integrity.
After data cleaning, a series of quantitative statistical analyses were performed to gain insight into the effect of different drug regimens on tumor volume. These analyses included calculations of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM) for tumor volume for each drug regimen. These statistics provided critical insight into the distribution, spread, and overall variability of tumor volumes under each drug regimen, allowing for more nuanced interpretations of drug efficacy.
Visual representations of the data were then created, including bar graphs to observe the distribution of data points across drug regimens and pie charts to illustrate the distribution of sex in the mouse sample. These visualizations are critical for intuitively understanding the demographic distribution and data density for each drug regimen, which in turn aids in interpreting the generalizability of the study results. A more focused analysis of specific drugs such as Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin was performed, including calculations of quartiles, interquartile range (IQR), and potential outliers in tumor volumes to understand the spread and central tendency of the data.
In addition, a deep dive into the Capomulin regimen was performed, highlighting its effects on individual mice over time through line plots and exploring the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume through scatter plots. This relationship was quantified by calculating the correlation coefficient, which is critical for understanding how strongly these variables are related, and by linear regression analysis, which is essential for making predictions about tumor volume based on mouse weight.
In conclusion, this analytical process of data cleaning, statistical analysis and visualization provided a deeper understanding of the efficacy of the drug regimens. Particular attention was paid to the Capomulin regimen, where extensive analysis and visualization provided critical insights into its efficacy and its relationship to various parameters such as time and weight, paving the way for more informed and accurate interpretations and conclusions about the drug's potential therapeutic applications.
